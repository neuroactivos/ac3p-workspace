## INSTRUCTIONS ##

This workspace contains a number of coding challenges organized into collections.

Each folder under `collections` is a collection of challenges, organized in their own folders.

For example `collections/testCollection/testChallenge/` is the path to a challenge named `testChallenge` which is inside a collection named `testCollection`.

To practice challenge solving, move into one of the challenge folders, read the `CHALLENGE.md` and start working there.

When you finish, move to another challenge folder and work there to solve that other challenge.

The `acpp` tool is used to build and test your program. Read the usage guide in file `ACPP.MD`.

Read `RULES.md` to understand the limits and general rules and conventions when coding solutions.

Follow instructions in `INSTALL.md` to install the `acpp` tool and start working on challenges.
