## INSTRUCTIONS ##

This workspace contains a number of coding challenges organized into collections.

Each folder under `collections` is a collection of challenges, organized in their own folders.

For example `collections/testCollection/testChallenge/` is the path to a challenge named `testChallenge` which is inside a collection named `testCollection`.

To understand the challenge and code a solution, move into one of the challenge folders, there you should read `RULES.md` and `CHALLENGE.md` before start working there in your favorite editor or IDE. It's recommended to open that challenge folder as the root of your IDE project/folder.

When your done, move to another challenge folder and work from there to solve that other challenge.

The `acpp` tool is used to build and test your program. Read the usage guide section inside `RULES.md`.

Also, in `RULES.md` there is must-read information required to understand the limitatios, general rules and conventions when coding and testing solutions.

Follow the instructions on `INSTALL.md` to install the `acpp` tool, before start working on any challenge.
