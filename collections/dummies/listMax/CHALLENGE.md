# Challenge: List Maximum #

## Objective ##

Write a program that reads a list of integers and outputs the largest integer in the list.

### Input Format ###

The first line of input contains a single integer, `N`, representing the number of integers in the list, where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`.

Each of the next `N` lines contains a single integer. These integers make up the list that the program will process.

### Output Format ###

The program should output a single integer, representing the largest integer found in the list.

### Constraints ###

- The integers in the list can be negative, positive, or zero.
- Each integer in the list will fit within the standard 32-bit signed integer range.

## Example 1 ##

### Input ###

```
5
1
-2
3
7
4
```

### Output ###

```
7
```

__Explanation__

The largest integer in the list `[1, -2, 3, 7, 4]` is 7, which is outputted by the program.

## Example 2 ##

### Input ###

```
3
-1
-3
-2
```

### Output ###

```
-1
```

__Explanation__

The largest integer in the list `[-1, -3, -2]` is -1, which is outputted by the program.
