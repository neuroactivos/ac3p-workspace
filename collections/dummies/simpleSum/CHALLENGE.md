# Challenge: Simple Sum #

## Objective ##

Write a program that receives two integers (which may be positive, negative, or zero) and calculates the sum of these two integers. The program should output this sum as a single integer.

### Input Format ###

The program should accept two lines of input:

- The first line will contain the first integer, `A`, where `-10^6 ≤ A ≤ 10^6`.
- The second line will contain the second integer, `B`, where `-10^6 ≤ B ≤ 10^6`.

### Output Format ###

The program should output a single integer, representing the sum of `A` and `B`.

### Constraints ###

- The input integers can be negative, positive, or zero.
- The sum must fit within the standard 32-bit signed integer range.

## Example 1 ##

### Input ###

```
5
3
```

### Output ###

```
8
```

__Explanation__

The sum of 5 and 3 is 8, which is outputted by the program.

## Example 2 ##

### Input ###

```
-3
6
```

### Output ###

```
3
```

__Explanation__

The sum of -3 and 6 is 3, which is outputted by the program.
