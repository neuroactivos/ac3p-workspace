# Challenge: Sum All List Odd Numbers #

## Objective ##

Write a program that reads a list of integers and outputs the sum of all the odd numbers in the list.

### Input Format ###

The first line of input contains a single integer, `N`, representing the number of integers in the list, where `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`.

Each of the next `N` lines contains a single integer, representing the elements of the list.

### Output Format ###

The program should output a single integer, representing the sum of all the odd numbers found in the list.

### Constraints ###

- The integers in the list can be negative, positive, or zero.
- Each integer in the list will fit within the standard 32-bit signed integer range.

## Example 1 ##

### Input ###

```
5
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Output ###

```
9
```

__Explanation__

The sum of the odd numbers in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is 9 (`1 + 3 + 5`), which is outputted by the program.

## Example 2 ##

### Input ###

```
4
-3
-2
7
8
```

### Output ###

```
4
```

__Explanation__

The sum of the odd numbers in the list `[-3, -2, 7, 8]` is 4 (`-3 + 7`), which is outputted by the program.
