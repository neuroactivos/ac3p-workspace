# GENERAL RULES AND CONVENTIONS #

Please read `README.md` first.

## Standard Input and Output ##

Your program must read inputs from standard input and write outputs to standard output.
Follow the input and output format specified in each challenge description meticulously. Do not add extra text or data to the output, such as prompts or debug messages.

All lines from input finish with a line separator (\n), and no extra linea are present.

All lines the program outputs must end with a line separator (\n). Do not output extra lines.

## Coding your solution ##
 
All your solution must be contained inside a single file named `program.cpp`.

The program must have a main method and exit with exit code 0.

Your program must not interact with the filesystem, spawn processes, initiate network connections, or explicitly handle threads (including using threading libraries). The focus should be on solving the algorithmic problem using the main thread of execution.

## Debugging ##

Temporary debug messages should be written to the standard error output (stderr). These messages must be removed from your final submission.
The standard error output is not assessed and can be used for debugging purposes during development.

## Libraries ##

Only standard C++ libraries are allowed. Usage of external libraries or frameworks not included in the standard library is prohibited.
Filesystem, Processes, Network, and Threading Restrictions

## Performance and Optimization ##

Pay close attention to the challenge's specifications regarding execution time, memory usage, and input/output size constraints. Your solution should be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently within these limits.
Code efficiency matters. Inefficient solutions that exceed time or memory constraints will be disqualified.

## Memory Management ##

Manage memory wisely. Avoid unnecessary memory consumption and ensure that your program does not cause memory leaks.

## Execution Time ##

Your program must complete execution within the time specified in each challenge. Solutions that exceed this time limit will be considered incorrect.

Other limits are also imposed upon your program when run againts test cases.
